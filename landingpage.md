The search engine for language learning

[Name] helps you find interesting content with a language complexity you can understand.

Problem description:
Learning a language is all about spending time with it: Reading, listening and also a little bit of speaking. But finding content to consume is not an easy task: The most effective way is to consume content that you would also consume in your main language, but this often conflicts with the constraint of language complexity. There is a lot of content designed for beginners / known to be “easy”, but often it’s not very interesting or it doesn’t follow a specific pattern.

How [Name] can solve this:
Our web crawlers go through thousands of pages and create a highly dynamic “language complexity fingerprint”. This allows us to provide search results depending on the vocabulary a user understands.

Someone who is searching for “news” and just started learning french would see something like this:
[X]

Someone who’s already speaking for a year would get more complex results:
[Y]

[Name] optimizes content for containing about 5-10% new words, which has proven to be optimal. At the same time, it tracks your vocabulary.
